                <p>We're excited to share that our online game development tutoring services are launching soon! While we're putting the finishing touches in place, we're not booking sessions just yet but we expect to begin services in late August 2025. If you're interested in one-on-one game dev or programming support, now's the perfect time to join the waitlist. This ensures you'll be among the first to hear when sessions become available. We'll reach out directly as soon as we're ready to get rolling!</p>
