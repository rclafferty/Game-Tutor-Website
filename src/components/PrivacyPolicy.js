                <h3>Limitations on Deletion Requests</h3>
                <p>While we respect your right to request deletion, certain data (such as scheduling records or progress tracking) is essential to provide ongoing tutoring. If you request deletion of this data, we may be unable to continue delivering our services.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, we are required under U.S. federal and state laws to retain certain transaction and business records for legal and tax purposes. Specifically:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We must retain records of all financial transactions for a minimum of 3 years to comply with IRS regulations.</li>

                <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>Our services are not directed to individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information promptly. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.</p>

                <p>We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and take privacy seriously for all users under 18. While COPPA applies only to children under 13, we apply similar safeguards for all minors.</p>

                <h3>Parental Consent</h3>
                <p>For students under the age of 18, we require parental consent before collecting any personal information. Parents or guardians must provide consent for their child to use our services and to collect, use, and share their child's personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. This consent is typically obtained through a signed Parental Consent Form provided during onboarding.</p>
                <p>Parents or guardians have the right to review, correct, or delete their child's personal information at any time. If you are a parent or guardian and wish to exercise these rights, please contact us using the contact information provided below in the Contact Us section.</p>
                <p>We encourage parents and guardians to monitor their children's online activities and to educate them about the importance of privacy and data protection.</p>
                <p>Tutoring services will not be delivered to a minor until this consent has been received.</p>
                <p>Parents may withdraw their consent at any time, at which point tutoring services will be discontinued for the minor, and data deleted in accordance with our data retention policy.</p>

                <h3>What Information We May Collect From or About Minors (With Consent)</h3>
                <p>Once parental or guardian consent is obtained, we may collect the educationally relevant information about the minor student listed above. All such data is collected only to provide personalized instruction and to ensure a positive, effective learning experience.</p>

                <h3>What Information We Do Not Collect or Track From Minors</h3>
                <p>We do not knowingly collect or track any personal information from minors that is not directly related to their educational needs. This includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Social Security numbers or other sensitive personal identifiers.</li>
                    <li>Location data beyond what is necessary to provide services (e.g., timezone for scheduling).</li>
                    <li>Behavioral tracking or profiling unrelated to educational performance.</li>
                    <li>Any information that could be used to identify or contact the minor outside of the tutoring context.</li>
                    <li>Information about the minor's family or household that is not directly relevant to the tutoring services provided.</li>
                    <li>Biometric data (e.g. facial recognition, fingerprints)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Use of Communication Tools</h3>
                <p>We may use communication tools such as email, chat, or video conferencing to interact with minor students. These tools are used solely for educational purposes and to facilitate tutoring sessions. We do not use these tools to collect personal information beyond what is necessary for the tutoring services.</p>
                <p>We encourage parents and guardians to monitor their children's use of these communication tools and to discuss online safety and privacy with them.</p>
                <p>Parents and guardians are always welcome to observe any tutoring sessions involving their minor children. We encourage parental involvement and are happy to accommodate parental presence during live sessions.</p>
                <p>If communication platforms such as Discord or Zoom are used:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We recommend minors use an account managed by a parent or created with parental oversight.</li>
                    <li>We will never initiate private communication with a minor outside of scheduled sessions.</li>
                    <li>Parents may request transcripts, session notes, or recordings at any time.</li>
                    <li>We will not share any personal information about the minor with third parties without parental consent.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If sessions are recorded, the recordings are stored securely and used solely for internal quality assurance and educational review. These recordings are not shared with third parties and are not made available to parents or guardians by default. Parents may request a summary or deletion of any recording that contains identifiable personal information, in accordance with applicable privacy laws.</p>
                <p>While we do not share session recordings, parents are always welcome to observe their child's live sessions.</p>

                <h3>Policy Enforcement</h3>
                <p>We take violations of this policy seriously. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without parental consent (as defined under COPPA), we will take immediate action to investigate and rectify the situation. This may include terminating services, deleting collected data, and notifying parents or guardians as appropriate.</p>
